Tako Movable Comments fix and update
https://wordpress.org/plugins/tako-movable-comments/

* Move comments across posts, pages, and posts under custom post types
* Automatically move all the nested comments under the comment chosen to be moved
* Manual insertion of post ID is not needed; post/page can be chosen under a dropdown list
* No more ugly dropdowns! Autocomplete enabled; searching for post title becomes easier
* Comments can be move in bulk! No more slaving around and moving only one comment at a time!
